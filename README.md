# Warn-in-Target-Detection
A computer vision based solution using RCNN models with pixellib library, with the aim to select from a huge categories of items or targets one wants to detect. Once the selected object appears in the field of view of the camera, an alarm will be triggered. This can be useful in detecting certain trespassers in the house or detecting any specific object anywhere. One can use IP?Wifi enabled cameras here as well.
